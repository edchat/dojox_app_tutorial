In the previous tutorial, <a href="/documentation/tutorials/1.9/dojox_app/contactsList/">Getting Started with dojox/app</a>,
we created a simple Contacts List Application using the <code>dojox/app</code> library.
This tutorial will use a phone form factor and two views, the "list" view from the previous tutorial and a new "details" view.
