In the previous tutorial, <a href="/documentation/tutorials/1.9/dojox_app/contactsPhone/">Creating a Contacts Application with a phone form factor</a>,
we created a Contacts Application with two views, a "list" view and a "details" view.
This tutorial will add support for a tablet form factor in addition to the phone form factor.  On a tablet the Contacts
Application will use a 2 column layout with the "list" view on the left and the "details" view in the center.
